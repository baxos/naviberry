						SYNOPSIS
================================================================================================================
	
The idea behind this project is to create a cheap robot, which can draw a map of it surronding and afterwards navigate on that map.
It will draw the map as a 2D map(bird view), it will be drawn using a IR distance sensor. So when we can confirm there is a object(wall, furniture, etc..) we will add
a block on that position of the map. The more map we have of the area the robot is in, the better it should be to navigate and select the fastest path avaiable.  The pathfinding algoritm is a slighly modified to my needs A* algorithm, one of the modifications is to keep a greater distance to walls/blocks. Also to speed up the process, we will constantly update an look-up copy of the map for faster reference.The algoritm will firstly be constructed and tested in the windows enviroment, to be more specific it will run under the .Net framework written in C#, later it will be translated to either Python, ruby or C.   I'll have to parts in this program, where I have the main target which is the robot which is being controlled by a Raspberry PI computer. The second target will be the "Control App" which will run on a Windows system.
As said earlier the main target(the robot) will be controlled by a Raspberry PI computer. The computer will control I/O for the report and act as the brain. The robot ill need motors to be able to move and a IR sensor so we can see what is in front of us.The Raspberry will run under Raspbian Linux a Debian release designed for the Raspberry PI. Since C# is not widel used and not very well supported on the Linux platform, we'll be looking after other alternatives. This is properly gonna be either Python, Ruby or C.
