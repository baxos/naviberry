The server is supposed to be running on the robot. 

It will read the encryption key on startup, set up socket and wait for connection.
When someone is connects to it, it will wait for a encrypted password. If it fails 3 times, it will ban connections for 5 minutes..

All communication between server and client will be encrypted using the encryption key[1].


Definitions of commands can be find in the header file "comm.h"
Some of the most important are:
=============================
1. start
2. disconnect
3. status
4. ping
5, stop
=============================

When server is connected properly to the correct client it will send the signal "SERVER_WAITING" when client recieves this, it can send commands
to the server. When the server recieves a command, it will respond with "SERVER_SUCCESS", **NOTE** this doesn't mean that it recognized the command.
The server will though respond with "SERVER_UNKNOWN_COMMAND" if the command isn't recognized later in the process..
