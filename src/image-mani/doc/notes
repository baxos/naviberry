It appears almost all images from Google is bitmapinfoheader
Therefore support for this header is very needed





Quick notes

Attack on the header

Step 1.
Read first 14 bytes(This is the first header section in the bmp).
The first of theese bytes will determine what header type it is.

Step 2.
Read the next 12/40/64/108/etc..(header size in bytes) bytes of the bitmap.
Next save them structured in memory. See documentation for more info.

Step 3.
You are done my sir. If you studied the documentation enough you will know where the pixel table is starting in the file, by knowing the offset.
