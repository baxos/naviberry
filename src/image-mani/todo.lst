* Add support for BITMAPINFOHEADER, it should be easy when V4 is already supported
-> Link from MS "BitmapInfoHeader file format documentation" : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd183376%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

* Create library for handling the headers instead of having in the main code
-> Should be mostly copy/paste, but do it nicely please!
